# Peer Review: Getting and Cleaning Data project
This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 
It has the instructions on how to run an analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

## Dataset
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files
1. `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations

2. `run_analysis.R` performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. `FinalData.txt is` the exported final data.
